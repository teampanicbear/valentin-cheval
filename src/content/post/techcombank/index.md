  No clear requirements or team structure, a very complex product and very
  little time - let's see how we made a blockchain explorer:

  DefiMetachain is the ERC-20 blockchain solution of Defichain. As part of this product, I worked on the blockchain explorer.

## About Defichain

DeFiChain is a specialized blockchain dedicated to decentralized finance (DeFi). It offers functionalities like decentralized lending, token wrapping, and exchanges.

Prioritizing high transaction throughput and security, it is a non-Turing-complete blockchain, focusing on financial services efficiency, with features built upon the Bitcoin ecosystem for enhanced reliability.

Defimetachain goal was to bridge the Bitcoin and Ethereum gap.

## My Role in Defichain

I was a senior product designer for the Birthday Research Team, the R&D arm of which defichain was one of the products.

I worked on Defichain Consortium, Light wallet mobile and desktop, branding as well as DefiMetaChain's project the ERC-20 blockchain of Defichain; namely their blockchain explorer and website.

## Defining the Problem being solved

The goal of the explorer within the DefiMetaChain ecosystem was of a guide:

It would help user navigate DefiMetachain's blockchain, finding blocks, transactions, wallets and all blockchain related tasks, helping us with transparency and chain's health.

## Setting up the conversation

The project and team was very ad hoc, as we were already strained on other projects;

I took the project as the lone designer and worked directly with the blockchain engineers.

We had very little clear understanding on our actual target, very little time and no proper team structure for it; it was like an internal start up.

## Embracing chaos

When faced with uncertainty, the best solution was to follow what already existed and scale back based on later feedback.

The product was utilitarian, and deeply constricted to technical requirements and having too much useful information was less hurtful than too little.

We had to avoid the paralysis analysis and get started.

Constant testing and dog fooding would be our guide.

Resilience, self-reliability and speed were key.

## Final UI

We went through several rounds of parrallel internal testing and reviews, using prototyping on several different platform, to make sure the MVP would answer all needed requirements.
