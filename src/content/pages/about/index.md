vision:
  content: "As a designer and Rotarian, I believe in service above self. I believe
    being a designer is being a servant, in the most noble sense of the term;
    it's dedicating yourself to finding the right balance between user needs and
    business goals. I follow Design Thinking principles: metrics used to iterate
    fast and verify hypothesis. I believe in constant testing and fail fast,
    learn fast principles."
