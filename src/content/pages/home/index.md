        As a motion designer on his team, I've received tremendous support and
        inspiration from Valentin.


        On any given day, if there was a UI sketch on a piece of paper, it belonged to Valentin. His deep knowledge of design is evident, and his work never fails to impress me. I've always been curious about what makes his work so distinct and beautiful. In my eyes, he is the finest designer on the team, known for his high-quality work (and his suits, of course).


        Despite his reserved nature, he's an excellent mentor with a kind heart. He's open about his failures and never brags about his successes. He always listens attentively and offers advice on not just my professional skills but also on interpersonal ones. His sense of humor keeps our conversations incredibly engaging. We've remained friends to this day.


        Having Valentin on your team guarantees that it will be distinguished by great suits, a notable beard, and exceptional design work (some sense of humor too).

        His empathetic approach ensures that user needs are always at the forefront of his mind.

        In addition to his user-centric approach, Valentin is a skilled UI designer. He has an innate ability to create visually appealing and aesthetically pleasing interfaces that are both engaging and intuitive.


        Valentin's leadership skills are equally impressive. He can naturally motivate and inspire his team members, creating a positive and productive work environment. He is also a great listener, always willing to take feedback from his team and stakeholders. His versatility is one of his greatest strengths.

        Working with Valentin has always been a pleasure: he is focused and
        committed to excellence both in terms of quality and in terms of
        deadline. He showed a unique ability to be as much detail-oriented as
        taking an eagle's eye view on systems and products.


        His ability to understand unique product challenges and meet them is outstanding, and he brought both vision and expertise during our multiple collaborations.

        He is deeply proactive, and provides and receives feedback in a professional and constructive manner.


        I cannot recommend Valentin enough for a leading position in any UX endeavour, and should the need ever arise his profile would sit on top of my recruitment shortlist.

        I am delighted to recommend Valentine, a former Lead Designer at
        Bitcoin.com. During his time with us Valentine showcased exceptional
        product design and leadership skills.


        In his role, he oversaw the UI/UX and played a crucial part in feature development and enhancing product experiences. His expertise with design tools like Figma, Sketch, and Adobe greatly contributed to the seamless execution of design phases from start to finish.


        Valentin led the design for a new casino project, showcasing his ability to handle complex tasks from concept to completion. His skill in collaborating across various departments and effectively incorporating feedback into designs was impressive.


        Beyond his technical skills, Valentin demonstrated strong teamwork, communication, and problem-solving abilities. He showed a consistent drive for improvement, seeking feedback to refine his work and processes.

        I've had the chance to be Valentin's direct manager at Bitcoin.com - and
        I can not recommend him enough for any creative position he aspires to!


        Valentin is a highly creative individual who has an outstanding ability to materialize unique design solutions with an innovative touch. He understands art styles and contextual styling like only a few others can. If rendering top-notch designs is his jackhammer, developing the backbone for UX with clean information architecture and wireframing for possible design solutions are his chisel and rake.


        His ability to carve out elegant and functional designs is reminiscent of a skilled artisan, chiseling away excess to reveal the essence of user experience. Ever so proactive, Valentin is on the top of his game when it comes to developing and delivering product design solutions.


        Valentin is a star, I'd work with him again in a heartbeat!
